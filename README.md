# HotZonev0.1

Hot Zone datapack for Minecraft (inspired by the Brawl Stars gamemode)

this version is designed for Minecraft 1.16.5 (for 1.17 you simply need to change the "6" in the pack.mcmeta file to a "7")

/function hotzone:start to start the game

There are 4 hot zones in the map, located at 100 75 0 (Zone 1), -100 75 0 (Zone 2), 0 75 100 (Zone 3), and 0 75 -100 (Zone 4). Each zone can have a maximum of 2500 points (fills up in 2 minutes 5 seconds, worth 25% of total progress) and all 4 zones need to be filled up in order to win the game. The first player to fully capture all 4 zones will win!

When a zone is captured by ANY player, it turns from obsidian to crying obsidian. This does NOT mean other players cannot capture that zone anymore; it only means that the player who filled up that particular zone cannot gain any more progress from that specific zone. When a zone is captured by a player, a message is also displayed to every player, informing them about which player captured which zone (called Zone 1, Zone 2, etc. See above).

*NOTE: The world spawn is supposed to be at 0 ~ 0. If you do not spawn at 0 ~ 0 because the datapack has not been activated yet when you first spawn in the world, simply use /kill to reset your spawn to 0 ~ 0 and then begin the game as usual.*
